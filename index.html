<!-- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links 
    to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications

            <p id="paragraph1">I am an up and coming developer. I am a current student at BYU studying Business and Technology Management. 
                I will graduate in December of 2024 at the current pace that I am going. I have some work experience in the IT field.
                I am taking a full-stack coding bootcamp through UC Berkeley to further develop my skills and be better equiped for the development world.
            </p>
            <p id="paragraph2">I am most confident in my Python skills, but have been developing my Javscript and web development skills recently. 
                I have been coding for a little over a year and a half now and have fallen in love with it. It is something that I find very enjoyable
                and something that I want to turn into a career. I changed my major a lot in college and have a lot of various expereinces because of that. 
                I wouldn't change the pathway that I have been on, because it has led me here.
