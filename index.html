            <p>I am an up and coming developer. I am a current student at BYU studying Business and Technology Management. 
                I will graduate in December of 2024 at the current pace that I am going. I have some work experience in the IT field.
                I am taking a full-stack coding bootcamp through UC Berkeley to further develop my skills and be better equiped for the development world.
            </p>
            <p>I am mosts confident in my Python skills, but have been developing my Javscript and web development skills recently. 
                I have been coding for a little over a year and a half now and have fallen in love with it. It is something that I find very enjoyable
                and something that I want to turn into a career. I changed my major a lot in college and have a lot of various expereinces because of that. 
                I wouldn't change the pathway that I have been on, because it has led me here.
